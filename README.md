# nginx-auth-plus-externalname
Demo app for NGINX Plus Ingress Controller features

# Background
This repo contains files for a PoC to demonstrate the following requirements from NGINX Plus Ingress Controller
1. **Authentication subrequests**. This allows access to a given path [based on the result of a subrequest](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/) to an authentication service. We will protect the location ```/private``` with an authorization service that will return a 204 or a 401 response.
2. **ExternalName service**. This [has been supported](https://www.nginx.com/blog/announcing-nginx-ingress-controller-for-kubernetes-release-1-5-0/#ExternalName) since NGINX Ingress Controller 1.5 and is a Plus-only feature. Offical example from NGINX documentation is [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/main/examples/custom-resources/externalname-services).
3. **HTTP Header append and remove**. This is straightforward functionality to append or remove headers from requests to proxied upstream servers. We will use the native functionality of the [VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources/) Custom Resource Definitions.

# Prerequisites
1. **Auth service**. This can be inside or outside of the cluster. Typically, it is external to the cluster. In this demo I have set up an internet-reachable service that is extremely simple: it responds to every HTTP request with a 204 (success). I can manually change this to respond with a 401 (failed). When the NGINX Ingress Controller makes a request to this service, the response (either a 204 or a 401) will tell NGINX to allow or disallow the request, respectively.
2. **External service**. It may help to set up an external service that is capable of receiving HTTP requests on your expected port (80 or 443) as well as capable of receiving HTTP requests with the hostname you are planning to use.
3. **NGINX Plus JWT or cert and key**. You will need a way to pull or build the NGINX Plus Ingress Controller image. Personally I like to use a JWT token and K8s secret to pull the image from private-registry.nginx.com, as described [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/using-the-jwt-token-docker-secret/). So I'll be assuming that method in this example.
4. **Network ingress to NGINX Ingress Controller**. This lab doesn't cover how to get traffic into your K8s cluster. You must be able to expose the NGINX Ingress Controllers to network traffic yourself. Personally, I like to use F5 BIG-IP's and CIS like I do in [this lab I commonly use](https://github.com/mikeoleary/azure-aks-kic-cis/). In any case, this lab assumes you're able to hit your NGINX Ingress Controller pod as described in the architectural overview.

# Further enhancements (optional)
This demo assumes a basic lab with a single ingress controller. However in production environments it is typical to see multiple ingress controllers, and some additional requirements:
1. **Caching of authentication results.** The user experience can be improved by caching validation responses for a short time.
2. **Distributed caching.** (Distributed caching is a Plus-only feature). For NGINX Plus, we could show how the cache can be distributed across a cluster of NGINX Plus instances, by updating the keyâ€‘value store with the JavaScript module, as introduced in NGINX Plus R18. Caching, and distributed caching, are already documented well in an [existing guide](https://www.nginx.com/blog/validating-oauth-2-0-access-tokens-nginx/).
3. **Revocation of records from the cache**. If we cache successful authentications so as to improve user experience, it is wise to consider how we might revoke a cached authentication. This can be done with an API call (also a Plus-only feature).

# Troubleshooting
As I was setting up this lab, I made a few common mistakes. Here are some ideas to check if things aren't working as you expect:
1. Don't forget that to achieve some of these features, we need to use NGINX Plus (not the free open source version). So make sure you have pulled NGINX Plus Ingress Controller image.
2. When deploying NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, make sure your command line arguments
    * Include the [argument to enable Plus](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#-nginx-plus) (as opposed to open source)
    * Include the [argument to enable snippets](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#-enable-snippets)
3. When using ExternalName services, NGINX requires a resolver set in the ConfigMap. It's easy to mis-spell. It's "resolver-addresses" (plural, not singular). Check out [my example ConfigMap](install/common/nginx-config.yaml).
